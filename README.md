This spaghetti code will drive my grandparents crazy

The testing folder contains all sorts of semi-sober code used to test small ideas I had for the main project. 
There are V1, 2, and 3 of both client and server, they aren't forward-backward compatible. 
Each one is a major revision, I prbably should've included minor revs, but I didn't. :|
